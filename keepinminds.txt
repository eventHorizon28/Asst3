1. flag that libnetfiles gets is always 2 for some reason.
2. Make sure one thread is not able to close some other thread's file descriptor, create a linked list with the sfd and the netfd for this
3. see h_errno documentation in the assignment description
4. do error checking for -1 fd on the client side itself?
5. set h_errno for network establishment errors
6. when do we have to close the socket?
7. Can 1 client open multiple fds to the same file? test it on local open
ERRORS:
1. nread not working for some reason
2. threads not working
3. O_RDWR value being passed even when the flag is not O_RDWR
